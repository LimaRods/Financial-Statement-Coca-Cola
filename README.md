# Financial Statement and Ratio Analysis Coca-Cola

- I have had to analyse the financial statement and ratios ofa company during my trainee program at Brainnest.
- My team picked up Coca-Cola to analyse and after to prepare a 20 min presentation.
- I used Financial Modeling Prep API to retrieve published financial data of the company providing graphics and structured data to my team.
- As a consequence, I could quickly provide charts and structured data of companies financial statements and ratios for my team, and hence, speeding up and improving the analysis of my colleagues.
